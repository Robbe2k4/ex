<t align='center' color='#E48A36'>REGARDING VEHICLES AND AIRCRAFT</t><br />
<br /><t color='#E48A36'>Sometimes vehicles/aircraft can explode or disappear upon login. This is due to how Arma handles persistence. Arma was not developed to handle persistence. This gets introduced by mods such as Exile. Vehicles may not immediately spawn in their proper positions. The same goes for walls/constructed items. This can cause some collision issues, which can lead to vehicle explosions or despawns.</t><br />
<t color='#E48A36'>Here are some general rules/suggestions regarding the parking or storage of vehicles over a restart:</t><br />
<t color='#E48A36'> - Park your vehicles/aircraft facing North with room for the vehicle to spin 360 degrees.</t><br />
<t color='#E48A36'> - Don't park vehicles/aircraft on constructed floors.</t><br />
<t color='#E48A36'> - Don't park too close to other items. (i.e walls, vehicles/aircraft, safes, etc)</t><br />
<t color='#E48A36'> - Admins will not be replacing every vehicle/aircraft that explodes or despawns.</t><br />
